- MongoDB database or MongoDB Atlas account
- Git (optional)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository (if not already done):

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

    cd <project-directory>
2. Install project dependencies:
    npm install

## Configuration

1. Create a .env file in the project root and define the following environment variables:

    DATABASE_URL=<your-mongodb-uri>
    Replace <your-mongodb-uri> with your MongoDB Atlas connection URI.

## Running the API
    To start the API, run the following command:

    npm start
    The API will be available at http://localhost:3005 by default. You can modify the port in the index.js file if needed.

## API Endpoints
The API provides the following endpoints:

POST /api: Create a new data entry.
GET /api/getAll: Retrieve all data entries.
GET /api/:id: Retrieve data by ID.
PATCH /api/:id: Update data by ID.
DELETE /api/:id: Delete data by ID.
## Usage Examples
Here are some examples of how to use the API endpoints:

Inside your post man or rest file created in vs code, you can create the following data "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "John", "age": 30}' http://localhost:3005/api

### Retrieve All Data Entries

curl http://localhost:3005/api/getAll

### Retrieve Data by ID
Replace <data-id> with the actual ID of the data entry:
http://localhost:3005/api/<data-id>

### Update Data by ID
Replace <data-id> with the actual ID of the data entry and provide the updated data:

"Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Updated Name", "age": 35}' http://localhost:3005/api/<data-id>

### Delete Data by ID
Replace <data-id> with the actual ID of the data entry:

DELETE http://localhost:3005/api/<data-id>
